**What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?**
When you initialize a git repo, it creates the `.git` directory which is where
git will store metadata about your project's history. You need to do it so that
git can get things ready for you to make the first commit.

**How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?**
The staging area is where you put things that you are planning on including in
the next commit. The working directory is where are your files are stored, in
their current state. This allows you break off small logical commits as you
work, rather than always having to commit all changes you've made since your
last commit.
