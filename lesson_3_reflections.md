**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
Remote repositories are helpful when you're collaborating with other developers.
They also serve as a backup of your source code. Finally, when you use a hosting
service like Heroku, you deploy new changes to your project by pushing the
changes to a remote repository on their servers.
