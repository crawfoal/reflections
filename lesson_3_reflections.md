**When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?**
Remote repositories are helpful when you're collaborating with other developers.
They also serve as a backup of your source code. Finally, when you use a hosting
service like Heroku, you deploy new changes to your project by pushing the
changes to a remote repository on their servers.

**Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?**
If you're in the middle of working on something, it might be confusing to
suddenly see changes to the code base that you didn't make. Along those same
lines, the changes in the remote repo might have conflicts that you need to
resolve. You'd want to wait to do this until you're ready.
